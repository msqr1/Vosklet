#### The file Vosklet.js in this folder, used by the examples and the outer [README.md](../README.md), has been set to decompress explicitly using ```DecompressionStream``` (instead of implicit browser decompression) because I can't set a third-party (Github's) server response header. You can utilize this if you run into the same situation. Otherwise, please use the outer Vosklet.js instead. 

#### The motivation is that it will work right away when put into a HTML file. You can just make a local copy and try everything out quickly
